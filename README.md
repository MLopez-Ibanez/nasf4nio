Not Another Software Framework for Nature-Inspired Optimisation

This repository hosts the development of a Combinatorial Optimisation Application Programming Interface (API) for Nature-inspired algorithms and other methods by the Working Group on Software (WG4) of COST Action CA15140: Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice (ImAppNIO). 

__NOTE__ This is strictly work in progress. As the name implies, it is not an attempt to replace, or compete with, established software frameworks such as jMetal, ECF, ParadisEO, and others. Rather, the goal is to produce useful rules for the implementation of nature-inspired search and optimisation heuristics that are based on and guided by theoretical insights in their functioning.
